👋 Hi, I’m Dorine Mamboleo

Front-End Developer & UI/UX Designer focused on building usable, accessible, and well-structured web interfaces.

I work at the intersection of design and engineering, translating ideas and user needs into clean, responsive, and maintainable front-end solutions. I care less about hype and more about clarity, usability, and real-world impact.

🛠 What I Do

Front-End Development

Build responsive interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Convert designs into scalable, reusable UI components

Focus on performance, consistency, and cross-device compatibility

UI/UX Design

Design wireframes and prototypes with usability in mind

Apply user-centered design principles to reduce friction and improve flow

Design with accessibility and inclusivity as non-negotiables

Problem-Solving Mindset

I ask why before jumping into code

I iterate based on feedback, not assumptions

I’m constantly learning and refining my process

🚀 Currently Exploring

Modern front-end workflows and frameworks

Better design-to-code handoff practices

How good UX directly impacts user trust and adoption

🤝 Let’s Connect

I’m open to collaboration, feedback, and meaningful projects — especially those focused on tech for good, usability, and digital inclusion.
